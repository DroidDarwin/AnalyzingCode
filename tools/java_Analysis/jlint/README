Compilation problems:
---------------------
If Jlint won't compile for your system, remove the flag -DSLIST in the
Makefile, or upgrade to a newer version of the STL.

- Windows users:

To have .cc files be recognized as C++ source code, check out
http://support.microsoft.com/support/kb/articles/Q181/5/06.ASP

- MacOS X users (old versions of MacOS X):

In the first few lines of the Makefile (lines 6 and 7), replace
gcc with cc, and g++ with c++. Alternatively, you can create a symbolic link
for the compiler executables.

- Creating a new Makefile:

You can update the Makefile by typing
./mkmf.pl jlint antic readme <Makefile >__tmp__ ; mv __tmp__ Makefile

- Supported platforms:

Jlint is known to work with recent versions of Linux, Solaris, FreeBSD,
OpenBSD, Windows. There is no user support available, though, as this
program is not commercial.
